# Hop

Hop is a build tool for Clojure, like [Leiningen][] or [Boot][].

It's still early in development, and **not yet usable**.

[leiningen]: http://leiningen.org/
[boot]: http://boot-clj.com/

## What's the big idea?

Hop compiles a declarative build file into a shell script, which is
cached and then executed. The cache ensures Hop only needs to run its
transformation code once, so long as the build file remains the same.

The build file has a map of **tasks** that define shell commands. So
If the user runs `hop foo`, the shell command associated with `foo`
will be executed.

One may ask why this is better than just writing a shell script! Hop
allows **middleware** functions to be declared that transform the
build map. So a map of dependencies, source paths and other options
can be turned into a single (and often very long) shell command.

## Why's it good?

Hop compiles into a shell script, so it has minimal overhead. This
gives it a shorter startup time than Leiningen, once the cache is
established.

Hop is fully declarative, so its build file is more useful to third
party tools than Boot's.

Hop gives each task its own process, so tasks are more isolated than
they are in Boot.

Hop ultimately executes raw shell commands, so tasks can written in
other languages, such as Java or ClojureScript.

Hop tasks can come from external dependencies, or from files in your
project.
